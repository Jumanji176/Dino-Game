# DINO GAME
This game is inspired by the Google Chrome T-Rex Dinosaur game, but I have added few of my own features to it.

## Required modules and packages
These are the following packages used in the game's program:
- PyGame
- Numpy

You can install them via:  
`pip install pygame numpy`

## Game Controls:
__Jumping:__ Use the `SPACE` key or `UP_ARROW` key.  
__Ducking:__ Press the `DOWN_ARROW` key.
__Pause and play:__ Press `p` to pause or play the game, or click the pause/play button on the screen.  
__Show hit boxes:__ I have also added the ability to show the hit boxes of all objects in the game. To activate or disable this, press `h`.

## Previous Version:
- v0.0.2

## Latest Version:
- v0.1.0

## New Features:
- Ducking is now enabled;
- Birds can now spawn at different hights;
- A title screen has now been implemented;
- A save state has been added, allowing the high score to be saved;
- New background design and cactus design added;
- One more sound effect has been added for when the dino collides with an object.

## Notes:  
Sorry for all the repeated commits, there where multiple lines of code in the different files that I forgot to change, but it should work properly for now.  
I am still developing this game, and this is just the first version of it. I will later add more features to the game over time.
