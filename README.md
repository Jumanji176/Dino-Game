# DINO GAME
This game is inspired by the Google Chrome T-Rex Dinosaur game, but I have added few of my own features to it.

## Required modules and packages
These are the following packages used in the game's program:
- PyGame
- Numpy

You can install them via:  
`pip install pygame numpy`

## Game Controls:
__Jumping:__ Use the `SPACE` key or `UP_ARROW` key.  
__Pause and play:__ Press `p` to pause or play the game, or click the pause/play button on the screen.  
__Show hit boxes:__ I have also added the ability to show the hit boxes of all objects in the game. To activate or disable this, press `h`.

## Previous Version:
- v0.0.1

## Latest Version:
- v0.0.2

## New Features:
Major bug fixes including:
- Improved spawning of the cacti and birds,
- Improved speed/FPS of the game,
- The game will no longer slow down over time,
- More detailed hit boxes for the birds.

## Notes:
I have not yet added a duck feature for the dinosaur/player, thus the dinosaur/player cannot duck.  
I am still developing this game, and this is just the first version of it. I will later add more features to the game over time.
