# DINO GAME
This game is inspired by the Google Chrome T-Rex Dinosaur game, but I have added few of my own features to it.

## Required modules and packages
These are the following packages used in the game's program:
- PyGame
- Numpy

You can install them via:  
`pip install pygame numpy`

## Game Controls:
__Jumping:__ Use the `SPACE` key or `UP_ARROW` key.  
__Pause and play:__ Press `p` to pause or play the game, or click the pause/play button on the screen.  
__Show hit boxes:__ I have also added the ability to show the hit boxes of all objects in the game. To activate or disable this, press `h`.  

## Notes:
I have not yet added a duck feature for the dinosaur/player, thus the dinosaur/player cannot duck.  
I am still developing this game, and this is just the first version of it. I will later add more feature to the game over time.  
I have also included the .EXE file of the game, but it will only run if it is in the same directorry as the `Assets` folder.
